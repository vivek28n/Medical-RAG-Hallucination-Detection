# 🩺 Medical RAG Hallucination Detection

### Evidence-grounded Medical AI Assistant with Hallucination Detection, Confidence Scoring & Self-Correction.

</div>

---

## 🩺 Overview

**Medical RAG Hallucination Detection** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Medical AI Assistant designed to generate answers from trusted medical documents while checking whether the generated response is sufficiently supported by the retrieved evidence.

The system combines:

- Medical document retrieval
- Grounded LLM answer generation
- Evidence-based claim verification
- Hallucination detection
- Confidence scoring
- Self-correction

The core idea is:

> **Retrieve → Generate → Verify → Score → Correct → Respond**

The current prototype uses a trusted medical guideline PDF related to diabetes as its primary knowledge source.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a medical AI assistant that:

- Answers questions using trusted medical documents.
- Grounds generated responses in retrieved evidence.
- Detects potentially unsupported or contradictory claims.
- Calculates a confidence score for generated answers.
- Performs self-correction when an answer is unreliable.
- Provides source and page-level evidence for verification.

The system is designed to reduce the risk of hallucinated medical information by making retrieved evidence an explicit part of the answer-generation and verification pipeline.

Evidence-based Answer

The model is instructed to answer using the retrieved medical context rather than relying only on internal knowledge.

The pipeline also supports abstention when sufficient evidence is not available.

Status

✅ Gemini integration
✅ Grounded prompting
✅ Context-based answer generation
✅ Insufficient-evidence handling
✅ Retry handling for temporary API errors

🔍 Notebook 05 — Hallucination Detection

notebooks/Notebook_05_Hallucination_Detection.ipynb

This stage checks whether generated answers are supported by retrieved medical evidence.

Two complementary signals are used:

1. Semantic Similarity

Measures how closely the generated answer is related to retrieved medical documents.

2. Natural Language Inference

The retrieved medical evidence is treated as the premise and the generated statement as the hypothesis.

The NLI model evaluates:

Entailment
Contradiction
Neutrality
Support Score

The initial answer-level verification uses:

Support Score =
0.5 × Semantic Similarity
+
0.5 × NLI Entailment

The claim-level verification stage later uses an NLI-first evidence score.

Detection Categories
SUPPORTED
CONTRADICTED
POTENTIAL HALLUCINATION
Status

✅ Semantic similarity verification
✅ NLI verification
✅ Contradiction detection
✅ Claim-level verification
✅ Hallucination classification

📊 Notebook 06 — Confidence Scoring

notebooks/Notebook_06_Confidence_Scoring.ipynb

The system calculates an overall confidence score using multiple signals.

Confidence Formula
Confidence =
0.30 × Answer Semantic Similarity
+
0.30 × NLI Entailment
+
0.20 × Retrieval Quality
+
0.20 × Claim Consistency
Confidence Levels
≥ 0.80  → HIGH
≥ 0.60  → MEDIUM
< 0.60  → LOW

Confidence is used as an additional signal for deciding whether an answer should be corrected.

Status

✅ Confidence calculation
✅ Retrieval quality calculation
✅ Claim consistency
✅ Confidence bands
✅ Self-correction trigger logic

🔄 Notebook 07 — Self-Correction

notebooks/Notebook_07_Self_Correction.ipynb

This stage introduces a feedback loop for unreliable answers.

          Revision

The correction process identifies unsupported claims and provides the available evidence to the LLM so that the answer can be revised using only supported information.

Status

✅ Unsupported claim identification

📚 Dataset

The current prototype uses a trusted medical guideline document related to diabetes.

Retrieval

The project is currently based on public medical guideline material and does not use private patient data.

📌 Evidence Grounding

A central design principle of the system is that medical answers should be grounded in retrieved evidence.

Each retrieved chunk contains metadata such as:

Chunk ID
Page number
Source document
Retrieved text
Similarity information

This allows generated claims to be compared against specific medical evidence.

🧪 Testing & Evaluation

Testing is performed progressively throughout development.

Current testing areas include:

PDF processing
Retrieval relevance
Grounded answer generation
Semantic similarity
NLI verification
Claim-level verification
Hallucination detection
Confidence scoring
Self-correction
Integrated pipeline behavior

Future testing will focus on:

End-to-end API testing
Frontend interaction testing
Backend/frontend integration
Response consistency
Failure handling
